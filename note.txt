3 files always go together in JavaFX
    + Java Class
    + FXML
    + CSS

Sample package when create a FX project contains
    + Main.java. This is the main class for starting the sample application.
    + sample.fxml. This is the FXML file for defining the user interface.
    + Controller.java. controller class intended to handle user interactions with the UI.
